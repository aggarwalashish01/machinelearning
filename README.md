#Iris Flowers Classification Project

This is my first project of machune learning.Here i have applied various algoriyhms of machine learning, compared them and used the best one to predict the test set to solve a very popular problem .

The iris flowers have different species and you can distinguish them based on the length of petals and sepals. This is a basic project for machine learning beginners to predict the species of a new iris flower
