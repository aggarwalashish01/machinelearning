#project 1 - Iris Flowers Classification Project

This is my first project of machune learning.Here i have applied various algoriyhms of machine learning, compared them and used the best one to predict the test set to solve a very popular problem .

The iris flowers have different species and you can distinguish them based on the length of petals and sepals. This is a basic project for machine learning beginners to predict the species of a new iris flower

#project 2-Handwritten Digit Recognition using Python
The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors. The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.
